classdef (Sealed) GlobalSearch < AbstractGlobalSolver
%GlobalSearch A scatter-search based global optimization solver. 
%   A GlobalSearch object presents a solver that attempts to locate the
%   solution with lowest objective function value. GlobalSearch solver
%   first generates trial points employing a Scatter Search method. These
%   trial points are then filtered and fmincon is started from each of the
%   filtered points.
%
%   GS = GlobalSearch constructs a new global search optimization solver
%   with its properties set to defaults.
%
%   GS = GlobalSearch(PROP, VAL, ...) specifies a set of property-value
%   pairs that are applied to the global search optimization solver before
%   creating it.
%
%   GS = GlobalSearch(OLDGS, PROP, VAL, ...) creates a copy of the
%   GlobalSearch solver OLDGS. GS will have the named properties altered
%   with the specified values.
%
%   GS = GlobalSearch(MS) constructs a new GlobalSearch solver and copies
%   the common parameter values in the multi-start solver MS into the new
%   solver GS.

%   GlobalSearch method:
%       run             - search for the best solution of a given
%                         optimization problem
%
%   Typical workflow to run the GlobalSearch solver:
%   ==============================================
%   1. Set up the PROBLEM structure
%       PROBLEM = createOptimProblem('fmincon','objective',...)
%   2. Construct the GlobalSearch solver
%       GS = GlobalSearch
%   3. Run the solver 
%       run(GS,PROBLEM)
%
%   Example:
%      Run global search on the optimization problem 
%         minimize peaks(x, y); subject to 
%                   (x+3)^2 + (y+3)^2 <= 36,
%                   -3 <= x <= 3 and  
%                   -3 <= y <= 3.
%
%      Specify the first constraint in a MATLAB file function such as
%         function [c,ceq] = mycon(x)
%         c = (x(1)+3)^2 + (x(2)+3)^2 - 36;
%         ceq = [];
%
%      Implement the typical workflow
%         problem = createOptimProblem('fmincon','objective', ...
%         @(x) peaks(x(1), x(2)), 'x0', [1 2], 'lb', [-3 -3], ...
%         'ub', [3 3], 'nonlcon', @mycon)
%         gs = GlobalSearch
%         [x, f] = run(gs, problem)

   properties
%NUMTRIALPOINTS Number of trial points analyzed 
%   The NumTrialPoints property sets the number of trial points that are 
%   generated by the Scatter Search portion of the algorithm. Once all the 
%   trial points have been analyzed by global search, it will terminate.
%
%   See also GLOBALSEARCH, RUN, NUMSTAGEONEPOINTS       
       NumTrialPoints = 1000;
       
%BASINRADIUSFACTOR Factor to determine the amount of decrease in the basin radius
%   The BasinRadiusFactor property determines the factor that a given basin
%   of attraction radius will be decreased by when MaxWaitCycle
%   consecutive trial points lie in that basin. 
%
%   See also GLOBALSEARCH, RUN, MAXWAITCYCLE
      BasinRadiusFactor = 0.2;
      
%DISTANCETHRESHOLDFACTOR Factor to tune the effect of the distance filter
%   The DistanceThresholdFactor property provides the parameter to tune the
%   effect of the distance filter. In Stage 2 of the global search
%   algorithm, a trial point must pass three tests before a local solver is
%   started from that point. In the distance test, a local solver may only
%   be started from a given trial point, T, if the following holds:
%
%    For each local solution already located, L(i):
%        Distance between T and L(i) > DistanceThresholdFactor*maxdist(i)
%
%   maxdist(i) is an estimate of the basin radius for the i-th local
%   solution and is internally calculated.
%   As DistanceThresholdFactor approaches zero the distance filter effect
%   vanishes. This is appropriate if there are many closely spaced local
%   solutions. Increasing DistanceThresholdFactor increases the effect of
%   distance filtering, namely that the local solver will be called from
%   fewer points in Stage 2.
%
%   See also GLOBALSEARCH, RUN
      DistanceThresholdFactor = 0.75;
      
%MAXWAITCYCLE Maximum number of consecutive points analyzed before a  
%             threshold increase or a basin of attraction decrease
%   The MaxWaitCycle property sets a maximum number of consecutive trial
%   points for the following tests:
%
%   1) A trial point can be rejected (i.e. a local solver is not run from
%   the point) because the exact penalty function value at this point is
%   greater than a threshold. If MaxWaitCycle consecutive trial points are
%   rejected in this way then the threshold value will be updated with the
%   formula:
%       threshold = threshold + PenaltyThresholdFactor*(1.0+abs(threshold))
%
%   2) The radius of a basin of attraction of a located minimum is reduced
%   by the solver if MaxWaitCycle consecutive trial points lie in the
%   basin. The following formula is used to update the radius of the basin
%   of attraction, maxdist
%       maxdist = maxdist(i)*(1-BasinRadiusFactor)
%
%   See also GLOBALSEARCH, RUN, PENALTYTHRESHOLDFACTOR, BASINRADIUSFACTOR
      MaxWaitCycle = 20;
      
%NUMSTAGEONEPOINTS Number of trial points analyzed in Stage 1 
%   The NumStageOnePoints property is a positive integer that sets the 
%   number of trial points analyzed by the scatter search in Stage 1 of 
%   the algorithm. After analyzing this many points the best quality point 
%   is chosen and fmincon is run from that point.
%
%   See also GLOBALSEARCH, RUN
      NumStageOnePoints = 200;
      
%PENALTYTHRESHOLDFACTOR Factor to determine the update amount in the  
%                       threshold for rejecting trial points
%   The PenaltyThresholdFactor property is used to update the threshold
%   value in the formula:
%       threshold = threshold + PenaltyThresholdFactor*(1.0+abs(threshold))
%   A trial point can be rejected because the exact penalty function value
%   at this point is greater than this threshold. If MaxWaitCycle
%   consecutive trial points are rejected in this way then the threshold
%   value will be updated.
%
%   See also GLOBALSEARCH, RUN, MAXWAITCYCLE
      PenaltyThresholdFactor = 0.2;
